# ImageBoardInsights

A set of tools for doing in-depth data analysis on a query towards a Booru-style image board.

To use, copy the files from /configuration/_templates into /configuration and update/customize as needed.

Currently in the late POC stage, very limited UI functionality.

Documentation soon to come...
